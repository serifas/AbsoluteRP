# Absolute Roleplay

Absolute Roleplay is a plugin for FFXIV focused on streamlining roleplay for the end users.
For now this plugin is mainly focused on roleplay profiles such as one you would normally create with carrd.
You can view other peoples profiles (If not set to private or whitelisted) and bookmark them.
