# Absolute Roleplay

Absolute Roleplay is a plugin for FFXIV focused on streamlining roleplay for the end users.
For now this plugin is mainly focused on roleplay profiles such as one you would normally create with carrd.
You can view other peoples profiles (If not set to private or whitelisted) and bookmark them.

Current profile sections include...

BIO::
A profile bio to specify things such as your age, height, weight, alignment, at first glance, and so on.

HOOKS::
Hooks to see how you may relate or possibly start rp with others.

STORY::
Create compelling stories with chapter creation and management.

OOC::
Specify things people should know about yourself out of character.

GALLERY::
Add image url's to a list to display images in your gallery. (Image uploading coming hopefully soon.)

PRIVACY:
Set your profile to private so only whitelisted players can see it.
